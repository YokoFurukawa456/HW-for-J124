# HW for J124

This homework assignment is for J124: Data Journalism


### Data from CSV: Flight etiquette

This is the data from CSV
[Flight Etiquette](Flying-etiquette---Raw-Data.csv)
[Flight Etiquette - Pivot](Flying-etiquette---Pivot-Table-1.csv)

I chose the data on <ins>**Is it rude to recline your seat on a plane?**</ins> because this question resonates with me the most. I always struggle with deciding whether or not to recline my seat when flying home, worried about whether the person behind me will find it rude or uncomfortable. From this data, I found out that more than half of the people who answered the question don't actually think it's rude to recline one's seat. This finding makes me feel more confident about doing so on my next flight back to school.

Here's the chart that visualizes the data findings.
